# loraserver - the (simple) LoRaWAN server

The server is conceptually similar to the built-in servers found in LoRaWAN gateaways/concentrators;
it supports a single system with attached gateways. There is no roaming features in this server; it's 
just a series of gateways and a server that sends and receives data.
